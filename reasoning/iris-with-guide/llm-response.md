Okay, so I need to figure out the species of this iris based on the given measurements. Let me start by looking at the data provided. 

First, the measurements are:
- Petal width: 1.9 cm
- Petal length: 5.1 cm
- Sepal width: 2.7 cm
- Sepal length: 5.8 cm

I remember from the instructions that the first step is to look at the petal measurements because they are the most discriminative. The example given earlier mentioned that Setosa has very small petals, with petal length under 2 cm and petal width under 0.5 cm. 

Looking at the given data, the petal length is 5.1 cm, which is way above 2 cm, and the petal width is 1.9 cm, which is above 0.5 cm. So that immediately tells me it's not Setosa.

Next, I need to check if it's Versicolor or Verginica. The secondary features for Versicolor are petal length between 3-5 cm and petal width between 1.0-1.8 cm. The given petal length is 5.1 cm, which is just above 5 cm, and petal width is 1.9 cm, which is slightly above 1.8 cm. That's close to the upper limit of Versicolor's petal width.

But then I look at the Sepal measurements. Versicolor's sepals are typically between 5-7 cm for length and 2-3.5 cm for width. The given sepal length is 5.8 cm, which is within that range, and sepal width is 2.7 cm, which is also within the 2-3.5 cm range. So that fits Versicolor.

However, Verginica has larger petals, with petal length over 4.5 cm and petal width over 1.4 cm. The given measurements fit into that as well, but since the petal length is just above 5 cm, which is the upper limit for Versicolor, I need to see if there's any overlap.

Looking at the example provided, when petal length was 5.1 cm, it was classified as Versicolor. Also, the sepal measurements fit within Versicolor's typical range. So even though Verginica has larger petals, the given measurements are more aligned with Versicolor.

I don't see any clear overlap that would make it Verginica, so I think it's safe to classify it as Versicolor.

The iris specimen with the measurements:
- Petal width: 1.9 cm
- Petal length: 5.1 cm
- Sepal width: 2.7 cm
- Sepal length: 5.8 cm

is classified as **Versicolor**. 

**Reasoning:**
1. **Petal Analysis:** The petal length (5.1 cm) and width (1.9 cm) fall within the range for Versicolor, which has petal lengths typically between 3-5 cm and petal widths between 1.0-1.8 cm. Although the petal width is slightly above 1.8 cm, it is still within the acceptable range for Versicolor.
2. **Sepal Analysis:** The sepal measurements (5.8 cm length and 2.7 cm width) fit within the typical range for Versicolor, which has sepals usually between 5-7 cm in length and 2-3.5 cm in width.
3. **Classification Decision:** Based on the petal and sepal measurements, the specimen aligns more closely with the characteristics of Versicolor than with Setosa or Verginica. There is no clear overlap with Verginica's larger petal measurements.

**Conclusion:** The specimen is classified as **Versicolor** with high confidence.
